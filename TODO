o Is ptk realiable forwarded to c.l.p.tk so one could
  savely suggest to usenet user to post to ptk?

o add demos for Axis, Dial, OlWm

o add better tests

o Check if contribs also work on win32

o Axis has docs in comments that should be wrapped into POD

o Make TickerTape example into a composite widget?

o Find new home for removed book-examples 

o use Tk::WidgetDemo for demo(s) (maybe make demo ?)

o Update POD to reflect new status/support?

o Axis: authors lost:  email/http as in POD does both not work:

	   Kris Boulez            (Kris.Boulez@rug.ac.be)
	   Biomolecular NMR unit  <http://bionmr1.rug.ac.be/~kris>

   Larry Virden thinks it kris@uunet.be. He also tries to get a URL

o Larry Virden suggested:

	I think the README should indicate (and the code as well) what version
	of pTk IS verified to work with them.  Perhaps even create sub
	directories by version of perl and/or pTk for them.  Also, the platforms
	on which they are verified to work would be useful to mention.
