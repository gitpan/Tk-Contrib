History:

Version 0.05

	o patch of TiedListbox to fix scrolling

		Subject: Re: Database -> TiedListbox widget
		Date: Fri, 12 Dec 1997 09:45:47 -0700
		From: Andrew Allen <ada@hpesada.fc.hp.com>

Version 0.04

	o Typos fixed in README (Larry Virden <lvirden@cas.org>)

	o Many little documentation fixes (Larry Virden <lvirden@cas.org>)

	o (Mis)use Revision keyword of prcs for $VERSION.  '+1' offset
	  necessary to get a new $VERSION higher than 2.00x that was set
	  earlier by perforce.	

	o README: Added simple success reports table for this distribution

Version 0.03

	o now flat subdirectory structure

	o demos/tiedlistbox strict and -w clean

Version 0.02

	o added trivial tests: may only uncover possible -w warnings

	o Each contribution has it's own dir that a ready CPAN dist
	  after

		# add README file
		echo 'Makefile$' > MANIFEST.SKIP
		mkdir t && 
		perl Makefile.PL
		make manifest
		make dist

	  Blech!  Better remove subdir overhead and write a CPAN HOWTO

	o MM NAME attr set to Tk::Whatever => better perllocal.pod
	  entry but creates unnecessary auto/Tk/Whatever/.packlist

	
	o Removed FileDialog and WaitBox. They have their
	  own CPAN distribution already

	o Removed book-examples and TickerTape. They are not
	  widgets

Version 0.01:

	o Contrib tree from Tk402.003
