History:

Version 0.04

	o Typos fixed in README (Larry Virden <lvirden@cas.org>)

	o Many little documentation fixes (Larry Virden <lvirden@cas.org>)

	o (Mis)use $Revision: 1.4 $ of prcs for $VERSION.  '+1' offset necessary to
	  get a new $VERSION higer than 2.00x :-(

	o README: Added simple success reports lists for this distribution

Version 0.03

	o now flat subdirectory structure

	o demos/tiedlistbox strict and -w clean

Version 0.02

	o added trivial tests: may only uncover possible -w warnings

	o Each contribution has it's own dir that a ready CPAN dist
	  after

		# add README file
		echo 'Makefile$' > MANIFEST.SKIP
		mkdir t && 
		perl Makefile.PL
		make manifest
		make dist

	  Blech!  Better remove subdir overhead and write a CPAN HOWTO

	o MM NAME attr set to Tk::Whatever => better perllocal.pod
	  entry but creates unnecessary auto/Tk/Whatever/.packlist

	
	o Removed FileDialog and WaitBox. They have their
	  own CPAN distribution already

	o Removed book-examples and TickerTape. Th
